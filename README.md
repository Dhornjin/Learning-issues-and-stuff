# Learning
I'll start here, learning how to correctly use Github.
As far I know it's a place to past any created code. People can contribute to help or complete things?
There seem to be a way to make some folder to riganise it all.
I'll maybe scramble a bit some languages.
I'll past my attempt on making a personnal website when i complete it in my free time.
But the file will be in a mess i guess.
